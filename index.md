_The purpose of creating this effort was to promote more open source organizations and projects to adopt code of conducts. Through our experiences at the [@TODOGroup](https://twitter.com/todogroup), we strongly believe that code of conducts help set the ground rules for participation in communities and more importantly, help build a culture of respect. We hope by [sharing this with you](https://github.com/opencodeofconduct/opencodeofconduct.github.io) will enable you to easily establish a code of conduct for your respective open source community._


### Code of Conduct

Our open source community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be permanently banned from out community. This is at the discretion of [the Anti-Abuse team](/report-abuse.html).

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored.

Our open source community strives to:

- **Be open**: We invite anyone to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor.
- **Be considerate**: People use our work, and we depend on the work of others. Consider users and colleagues before taking action. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy, and documentation may negatively impact others.
- **Be respectful**: We expect people to work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and act with empathy. Do not turn disagreements into personal attacks.
- **Be collaborative**: Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. We
strive for transparency within our open source community, and we work closely with upstream developers and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts.
- **Be pragmatic**: Questions are encouraged and should be asked early in the process to avoid problems later. Be thoughtful and considerate when seeking out the appropriate forum for your questions. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.
- **Step down considerately**: Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, they
should make it known and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

### Definitions

Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names

- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect other GF members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse
- Publication of non-harassing private communication

Our open source community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. Our Anti-Abuse Team will not act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’ (because these things don’t exist)
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by emailing our Anti-Abuse team **[an email address]**. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please
include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally.  If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. A representative will then review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond.

## Consequences
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the representative may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from our community without warning.
